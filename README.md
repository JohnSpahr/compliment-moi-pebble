# Compliment Moi for Pebble
Get a compliment and some encouragement from your Pebble smartwatch with this fun little Pebble.JS app! Tested on a Pebble 301BL smartwatch running the latest firmware.

### Features
- Get a compliment or some words of encouragement!
- No need to update to the latest version of the app when new compliments are added! The [compliments.json](compliments.json) file that contains all the compliments is fetched whenever you run the app.
- When enabled, the all-new "Big Brain Mode" setting sometimes specifically tailors compliments to better match the current time of day.
